Lua drawing program w/ Love2d. As it is not finished it requires the LÃ–VE framework to run. My other TIC-80 project is frankly more fun than this but they are definitley different. This is on the backburner/barely started at the moment because I realized that I enjoy TIC-80 as a lua engine more. I'll finish this someday.... maybe....
